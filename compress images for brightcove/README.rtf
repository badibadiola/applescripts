\f0\fs24 \cf0 You can use these 2 droplets to compress image files to Brightcove standards.  The Video_Stills droplet resizes the image to 480x360 & uses the highest jpg compression available.  The Video_thumbs droplet resizes the image to 120x90 and then compresses it with the highest jpg compression.\

Both of these droplets modifies the images dropped on them so if you'd like to keep the original make sure you duplicate it first (select it and the press Apple-D).}
